      <details class="faq-item"><summary>Why GSREIT?</summary>
        <p>We treat our responsibility to investors with utmost seriousness. We have owned and managed more than 37 properties with 7,500+ units valued in excess of $700 million across the Southern U.S., driven by superior processes, relationships, and doing the right thing at every step.</p>
        <p>Our 506(c) private placement opens access to RIAs, family offices, and accredited investors aligned with long-term wealth creation and preservation.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item"><summary>Why Invest in a New Sponsor?</summary>
        <p>Our team is deeply involved across acquisitions, asset & property management, and investor relations. We leverage technology, maintain disciplined workflows, and keep decision-making integrated for speed and quality. Principals invest alongside our investors.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item"><summary>Why Perpetual Life?</summary>
        <p>Alignment with long-term strategies—steady distributions, tax efficiency, and compounding via our DRIP—without a forced exit timeline. Continuous offering allows regular entry and planning; our SRP supports structured liquidity.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item"><summary>Why UPREIT?</summary>
        <p>Potential tax deferral for contributing property owners via OP units; potential liquidity via SRP; access to professional management and diversified exposure; estate planning benefits including potential step-up in basis.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item"><summary>Why RIAs and FOs?</summary>
        <p>Shared values around fiduciary duty, diligence, transparency, and relationship-based advising. We provide flexible structuring and direct access to decision-makers to support informed, long-term real-estate allocations.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item"><summary>Why Core?</summary>
        <p>Core real estate can pair income stability and capital preservation with long-term growth. We operate every asset ourselves to drive NOI and capture reliable income with upside potential without proportionately increasing risk.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item"><summary>Why Southern US?</summary>
        <p>Strong population and job growth, expanding and diverse economies, and a favorable regulatory environment support durable demand for rental housing. We leverage deep regional experience and infrastructure.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item"><summary>What is the hold period?</summary>
        <p>Typical hold per asset is 3–5 years to stabilize operations and enhance value; as a perpetual-life vehicle, we retain flexibility to hold longer or exit sooner as market conditions warrant.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item"><summary>What are the potential tax advantages of an investment in GSREIT?</summary>
        <p>Possible advantages include: (1) Qualified Business Income (Section 199A) deduction for qualifying REIT dividends (reported on Form 1099-DIV), (2) no self-employment tax on REIT dividends, (3) potential classification of dividends as Return of Capital, (4) passthrough taxation at the REIT level, (5) depreciation benefits that may support ROC, and (6) estate-planning step-up in basis.</p>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item"><summary>What is the type of tax reporting?</summary>
        <p>Investors receive Form 1099-DIV, typically issued by January 31, with classifications for dividends (including Section 199A, capital gains, and ROC).</p>
